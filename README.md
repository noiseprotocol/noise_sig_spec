# spectemplate

This directory contains a template for writing extension documents for the Noise Protocol Framework.

Extensions are written using Pandoc-flavored Markdown.  The Makefile in this directory converts the Markdown to HTML and PDF format using pandoc and pandoc-citeproc.

This template requires a `spectools` directory containing some additional pandoc input files, which is pointed to by the SPECTOOLS environment variable.
